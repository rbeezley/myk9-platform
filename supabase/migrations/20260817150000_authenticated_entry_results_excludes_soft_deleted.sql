-- =============================================================================
-- view_authenticated_entry_results must exclude soft-deleted entries.
--
-- Companion to 20260817140000_entry_views_exclude_soft_deleted_entries.sql,
-- kept as its own migration because this view is far larger and has churned
-- more recently than the three rebuilt there -- a revert should be able to
-- take this one without taking those.
--
-- This is the entry view with real user-facing reads: 11 call sites, including
-- useShowStats and useJudgeShowStats via
-- apps/myk9show/src/hooks/queries/statsEntryMapper.ts. A tombstoned entry
-- therefore reached show and judge statistics, carrying its final_placement,
-- search_time_seconds and qualification with it.
--
-- Two reasons the gap was invisible:
--
--   1. An `ilike '%deleted_at is null%'` probe over pg_get_viewdef reports this
--      view as filtered. It is not. The match comes from `own_e.deleted_at IS
--      NULL` inside the is_show_exhibitor EXISTS subquery, which decides
--      whether the CALLER is an exhibitor at the show -- it never constrains
--      the row being returned. Probe the view's own WHERE clause, not its
--      whole body.
--   2. Unlike the three views in the companion migration, this one is
--      security_invoker = false. It runs as its owner, so RLS on entries is
--      not consulted at all and could not act as a backstop even in principle.
--
-- The predicate is added as `e.deleted_at IS NULL AND (<existing OR chain>)`.
-- The parentheses are load-bearing: AND binds tighter than OR, so without them
-- the filter would apply only to the can_manage branch and every other role
-- would keep seeing tombstones.
--
-- Scope is entries only. view_public_entry_results and view_own_entry_results
-- additionally carry `sh.deleted_at IS NULL`, but adding show-level filtering
-- to a manager-facing view would change what a secretary can see during show
-- recovery -- a deliberate decision, not a side effect of this fix.
--
-- Everything else is copied verbatim from
-- 20260802120001_restore_entry_results_view_scope.sql, the latest definition
-- of this view (confirmed against the applied database: same COMMENT, and no
-- later migration mentions the view).
