-- MYK9-1326: drop public.entries.promo_code_id, the last trace of promo codes.
--
-- MYK9-1299 (20261022034700) dropped public.promo_codes, its two RPCs and the
-- entries_promo_code_id_fkey foreign key, but kept the column because three
-- views project it and CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW cannot remove a column. On live
-- data the column is NULL on every row. This file drops the three views,
-- recreates each from its LATEST definition with ONLY the promo_code_id line
-- removed, re-asserts reloptions, comments and grants, then drops the index
-- and the column.
--
-- Bodies copied verbatim (minus one line each) from:
--   view_authenticated_entry_results              20261014214300 (owner-run)
--   view_authenticated_entry_results_replication  20261014214300 (owner-run)

--   view_authenticated_entry_results_replication  security_invoker=false  postgres=arwdDxtm, service_role=arwdDxtm, authenticated=r  none         yes
--   view_entry_with_results                       security_invoker=true   postgres=arwdDxtm, authenticated=arwd, service_role=arwdDxtm none         no
-- No grant to anon on any of them. A dropped-and-recreated view picks up this
-- project's ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES (anon gets full CRUD on a new relation),
-- so every grant is revoked and restated explicitly (LESSONS
-- replace-view-reloptions, grant-never-narrows).
--
-- The only dependent of any of the three views is the replication wrapper on
-- the inner view, so the drops need no CASCADE: dropped wrapper-first.
-- Dropping the column also drops its column-level SELECT grant to
-- authenticated (entries' authenticated column allowlist goes 57 -> 56).
-- Replicas keep a stale (always NULL) promo_code_id on rows synced before
-- this file until the row next changes; no client code reads it.

-- Fail fast rather than queue: the view drops hold ACCESS EXCLUSIVE until
-- commit, and the column drop needs it on entries. If a long transaction holds
-- entries, give up after 5s instead of stalling every read of these views.

COMMENT ON VIEW public.view_authenticated_entry_results_replication IS
  'Replication feed wrapping view_authenticated_entry_results, adding the shows join needed to replicate soft-deleted shows (MYK9-291). Owner-run (security_invoker = false) like the view it wraps; the score/payment gating is inherited from that inner view body, and the shows columns are reachable only for entries the inner view already admitted. Advisor security_definer_view ERROR accepted by design 2026-09-09 (docs/improve-audit-2026-07-11/009-advisor-disposition-sweep.md, Verdict 1). Any rebuild MUST carry WITH (security_invoker = false) inline -- CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW resets reloptions. The select list is explicit (MYK9-632): `entries.*` re-expanded on every rebuild and would have reordered the columns the moment the inner view gained one. moved_from_entry_id (MYK9-639) is appended after it. registration_confirmation_number (MYK9-659) is appended after that, so the offline receipt prints the same order reference as the online one -- guarded by the inner view''s can_view_admin alone (see that view''s comment), which is the entry''s access, not the enrollment''s. results_private (MYK9-969) is appended last and carried from the inner view, whose privacy mask already NULLed the result columns, so a replica on another exhibitor''s device never holds a private result. awaiting_registration_number (MYK9-1162) is appended after it, carried from the inner view, so a ringside device knows a held entry without reading dog_registrations.';
