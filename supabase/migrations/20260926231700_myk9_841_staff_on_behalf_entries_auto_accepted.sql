-- MYK9-841: a staff-keyed on-behalf entry is accepted on submit.
--
-- OWNER DECISION (2026-09-26, from MYK9-832 item 1): when a secretary/show
-- manager keys a mail-in entry ON BEHALF OF someone else, SHE is the reviewer
-- -- the entry should not also queue in her own review lane. Exhibitor
-- self-entries are unchanged, and the existing owner-approved rule that
-- payment is not acceptance still stands for them (entryStatusUiAdapter.ts:
-- a `paid` self-entry stays in the "Pending / needs review" bucket).
--
-- DECISION, SERVER-SIDE ONLY. Never trust a client flag (submission_source is
-- client-supplied and already gets clamped to what v_is_official allows, but
-- it was never meant to gate entry_status). This function already computes
-- v_is_official -- the same site-admin/secretary/club-admin check every other
-- staff-only branch in this function uses. "On behalf of someone else" is
-- decided by dog OWNERSHIP (owner_id or co_owner_id = the caller), not by
-- comparing the resolved handler to the caller: an official can key HER OWN
-- dog with a co-owner or an alternate handler as handler_id, and that is
-- still her own entry, not one she is reviewing for someone else.
--   - v_is_official = false                          -> exhibitor self-entry,
--     unchanged ('submitted').
--   - v_is_official = true, caller owns or co-owns
--     the dog                                         -> staff entering
--     THEIR OWN dog, unchanged ('submitted') -- she is not reviewing
--     herself, whoever the handler is.
--   - v_is_official = true, caller does not own or
--     co-own the dog (incl. a dog with no owner on
--     file)                                           -> on-behalf-of,
--     auto-accepted ('confirmed').
--
-- STATUS VALUE. 'confirmed' is deliberately used, not 'accepted' or 'paid':
--   - 'accepted' is not a legal value of entries_entry_status_check (grep
--     confirms the only ADD CONSTRAINT touching it since is
--     20260924094300_myk9_719_retire_scratch_requested.sql, which does not
--     include it).
--   - 'paid' IS legal but is the raw string entryStatusUiAdapter.ts special-
--     cases BACK into the review lane (payment-is-not-acceptance), which
--     would silently undo this fix for a cash/check on-behalf submission.
--   - 'confirmed' is legal, is not one of those two special-cased raw
--     strings, and getEntryStatusKind() (entryDisplaySelectors.ts) already
--     classifies it as kind 'accepted' -- exactly the bucket every accepted-
--     entry surface (Entry Management, My Entries, ringside) reads from.
--
-- ENTRY_STATUS_HISTORY. No new write needed: `entries_record_status_history`
-- fires AFTER UPDATE OF entry_status, never on INSERT (verified in
-- 20260716120000_entry_status_history_capture.sql), so the initial value --
-- 'submitted' before this migration, 'confirmed' or 'submitted' after -- was
-- never recorded there and still isn't; the trigger only captures later
-- TRANSITIONS, which are unaffected by this change.
--
-- ENTERED_VIA / AUDIT TRAIL. Not added. `v_submission_source` ('organizer' /
-- 'show_desk' vs 'self_service') already distinguishes staff-entered rows for
-- capacity evaluation, and no surface reads a "how was this entered" column,
-- so a new one would be unread state, not an audit trail.
--
-- Rebuilt from 20260926214700_myk9_824_submit_entries_handler_defaults_to_owner.sql,
-- the LATEST migration defining this function (`grep -l 'CREATE OR REPLACE
-- FUNCTION public.submit_show_entries' supabase/migrations/ | sort | tail -1`).
-- The only edits versus that migration: the new `v_entry_status` local and its
-- assignment just below the MYK9-824 handler-fallback block, and using it
-- (instead of the literal 'submitted') in the INSERT. The MYK9-824
-- owner-fallback logic itself is untouched.
--
-- Behavioral coverage: supabase/tests/myk9_841_staff_on_behalf_entries_accepted_test.sql
-- (behavioral SQL tests run only in CI -- no container runtime locally).
