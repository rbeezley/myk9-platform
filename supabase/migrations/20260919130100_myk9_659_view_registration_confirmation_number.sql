-- MYK9-659: carry the ORDER's confirmation number on the authenticated
-- entry-results views, so the exhibitor's receipt prints the same reference
-- online and offline.
--
-- What the survey found. `public.submit_show_entries` -- the ONLY server path
-- that inserts an entry row -- always writes `registration_id` from an
-- enrollment it has already resolved, and `public.enrollments.confirmation_number`
-- is NOT NULL with a trigger default from `generate_confirmation_number()`
-- (054_registrations_table.sql). So every order the app creates today already
-- owns an order-level reference: `MK9-000146`. Nothing needs minting. The live
-- registration-less rows are pre-link seed data, a closed population.
--
-- The defect is that the token only reached the client through the PostgREST
-- embed `registration:registration_id(confirmation_number)` on the account
-- read. The replica path could not make that embed offline: it attempted a
-- best-effort `enrollments` fetch which, on the dead show-day network that put
-- it on the replica in the first place, returns nothing. The receipt then fell
-- through to its `reference` prop -- the raw enrollment UUID. The same order
-- therefore printed `Confirmation #: MK9-000146` online and
-- `Reference: cdc232e8-6d0a-408b-8e14-2f4be11adc36` offline, which is both a
-- path-dependent identifier (MYK9-659 AC2) and the raw-UUID-as-label shape
-- MYK9-631 Q7 removed.
--
-- Mechanics this file is obliged to get right:
--
--  * The body is copied from 20260918193300 (MYK9-639), which is the LATEST
--    migration defining both views and is applied on the linked project
--    (`supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`, verified before writing this).
--    Everything below is byte-identical to that file except the one appended
--    column on each view, the one LEFT JOIN that feeds it, and the sentence
--    each COMMENT ON VIEW gains for it. 20260918193300 added a trailing
--    `moved_from_entry_id` to BOTH views, so this file appends
--    `registration_confirmation_number` AFTER it -- copying the pre-639 body
--    would have tried to rename that column, which CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
--    cannot do, and the push would have hard-failed.
--
--  * `WITH (security_invoker = false)` is restated INLINE on both views.
--    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW resets reloptions when the clause is omitted
--    (20260817190000, and the CLAUDE.md lesson). Verified live before writing
--    this: both views report reloptions `{security_invoker=false}`.
--
--  * The new column is appended at the END of each select list. CREATE OR
--    REPLACE VIEW may only add columns there.
--
--  * The join is `LEFT JOIN public.enrollments en ON en.id = e.registration_id`
--    -- a primary-key lookup, and LEFT so a registration-less legacy row still
--    returns (with a NULL reference) rather than dropping out of the view.
--
--  * No new GRANT is needed for the column. Neither view carries column-level
--    ACLs (`pg_attribute.attacl` is empty on both, checked live), so the
--    table-level `GRANT SELECT ... TO authenticated` below covers it.
--
--  * WHO SEES IT, stated plainly, because this column is NOT the sibling of
--    `payment_reference` it first looks like. Every other `can_view_admin`
--    column on this view is an `entries` column, also reachable under `entries`
--    RLS and the entries column allowlist. This one is a CROSS-TABLE column
--    from `public.enrollments`, reached by an owner-run LEFT JOIN that
--    evaluates no `enrollments` policy at all -- so `access.can_view_admin` is
--    the ONLY guard on it, and it is a different predicate from
--    `enrollments_select` (20260918173900), whose exhibitor arm matches
--    `enrollments.handler_id`, the person who PLACED the order.
--
--    That difference is DELIBERATE and is the rule this change adopts: the
--    order reference belongs to whoever the ENTRY belongs to. `can_view_admin`
--    is a show manager, the entry's own handler, or the dog's owner, so a
--    person whose own entry sits on an order gets that order's reference on the
--    receipt that lists their own fees -- even when someone else placed the
--    order. That is the one rule BOTH client read paths now apply: the online
--    account read prefers this column over the
--    `registration:registration_id(confirmation_number)` embed precisely so it
--    stops inheriting `enrollments_select`'s different answer, and the offline
--    replica rebuild calls the same resolver
--    (`services/database/entries/orderReferenceRule.ts`). The token is a
--    quotable order reference, not a lookup key: nothing in `apps`, `packages`
--    or `supabase/functions` filters or joins on `confirmation_number`.
--
--  * ACLs are re-asserted rather than assumed. CREATE OR REPLACE does not reset
--    them (only DROP does), but stating them keeps this file self-contained and
--    keeps the dormant-write REVOKEs from 20260912183000 in force.
--
-- PUSH WITH `--include-all`. This version sorts BEFORE the linked project's
-- current head: 20260918211700 (MYK9-642) was applied while this branch was in
-- review, so a plain `supabase db push` skips this file as "out of order" and
-- says nothing useful about it. Run:
--
--   supabase db push --include-all --project-ref sojmvhhwsjxmfistvzbe
--
-- The version is deliberately NOT renumbered: renumbering would move this file
-- after 20260918211700 in a tree where nothing between them touches these views,
-- buying nothing and rewriting a version another branch may already reference.
-- Out-of-order application is safe HERE specifically because no migration
-- between 20260918193300 and the current head redefines
-- `view_authenticated_entry_results` or its `_replication` wrapper -- verified
-- against `origin/main`, not this branch, with `git grep -l
-- view_authenticated_entry_results origin/main -- 'supabase/migrations/*.sql'`,
-- whose last entry before this file is 20260918193300. So this file is still
-- the LATEST definition of both views and cannot be silently reverted by a
-- later one.
--
-- NOT PUSHED by the authoring agent: `supabase db push` on the linked project
-- is Richard's to run. Until it lands, `registration_confirmation_number` is
-- simply not in the view, the client reads it as `undefined` through
-- `optionalColumn`, and the offline receipt prints no reference at all -- which
-- is the pinned MYK9-631 behaviour, never a raw UUID.

COMMENT ON VIEW public.view_authenticated_entry_results_replication IS
  'Replication feed wrapping view_authenticated_entry_results, adding the shows join needed to replicate soft-deleted shows (MYK9-291). Owner-run (security_invoker = false) like the view it wraps; the score/payment gating is inherited from that inner view body, and the shows columns are reachable only for entries the inner view already admitted. Advisor security_definer_view ERROR accepted by design 2026-09-09 (docs/improve-audit-2026-07-11/009-advisor-disposition-sweep.md, Verdict 1). Any rebuild MUST carry WITH (security_invoker = false) inline -- CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW resets reloptions. The select list is explicit (MYK9-632): `entries.*` re-expanded on every rebuild and would have reordered the columns the moment the inner view gained one. moved_from_entry_id (MYK9-639) is appended after it. registration_confirmation_number (MYK9-659) is appended after that, so the offline receipt prints the same order reference as the online one -- guarded by the inner view''s can_view_admin alone (see that view''s comment), which is the entry''s access, not the enrollment''s.';
