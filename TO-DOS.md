## Sprint Items (from 2026-02-15 audit)

### Large File Refactoring

Top 3 source files over 800 lines — refactor when next modified:

- [x] `apps/myk9show/src/services/scoring/OfflineScoringService.ts` (875 lines — closed as skip: cohesive service class, types/serialization already extracted, 500-line guideline has exceptions for cohesive classes)
- [x] `apps/myk9show/src/services/data-lifecycle/DataExportImport.ts` (859→471 lines — extracted types, CSV utils, import handlers)
- [x] `apps/myk9show/src/store/trialStore.ts` (858→560 lines — extracted types and helpers)

### `any` Type Hotspots

- [x] `apps/myk9show/src/utils/enhancedLazyLoading.ts` — removed blanket eslint-disable, added PreloadableComponent interface + type guard, Object.assign for property attachment, proper return types
- [x] `apps/myk9show/src/services/performance/RealUserMonitoring.ts` — declared LayoutShiftEntry, PerformanceEventTimingEntry, PerformanceLongTaskEntry, PerformanceWithMemory, NavigatorWithConnection interfaces
- [x] `apps/myk9show/src/services/performance/PerformanceBudgets.ts` — declared BundleStats/BundleStatsAsset/PerformanceWithMemory interfaces, Record<string,unknown> for context

### Dead Dependency Evaluation

- [x] Removed `firebase` from myk9show — dead code (FCM never configured, 4 files deleted: firebase.ts, FCMService.ts, useNotifications.ts, settings/NotificationSettings.tsx). Updated CSP, bundle optimizer.
- [x] Removed `pdfjs-dist` + `puppeteer` from myk9q devDependencies — zero imports in src/

- Documented 4 potential source bugs in `docs/potential-bugs.md`

## Code Quality Sprint — Session 2 Complete (2026-02-17)

- [x] Eliminated 24 `as any` casts in packages (3 files)
- [x] Eliminated 61 `as any` casts in myK9Show (25 files — source + test)
- [x] Removed all 18 `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` suppressions (6 files)
- [x] Promoted ESLint `no-explicit-any` from `warn` → `error` in root config
- [x] Fixed 2 pre-existing typecheck errors (LazyComponents.tsx, dogsService.ts)

## Show Not Visible After Wizard Publish - 2026-02-22 06:29

- [x] **Debug show not appearing after Create and Publish** — Root cause: wizard saved to IndexedDB/Zustand via `addShow()` but `ShowDetailsPage` reads from React Query cache (Supabase). Show existed locally but React Query never knew about it. **Fix:** Seed React Query cache (`showQueryKeys.detail` + `showQueryKeys.lists`) in `useShowCreationWizardActions.ts` before navigating.

## Show Creation Wizard Bugs — 2026-02-24

Bugs found during end-to-end testing of the Show Creation Wizard via Claude Preview.

### CRITICAL: Classes Not Persisted After Publish

- [x] **Classes fail to save to Supabase (52 unhandled promise rejections)** — Fixed: wizard `createClasses()` now uses `replicatedClassesTable.createClass()` with async/await instead of fire-and-forget `addClass()` via direct Supabase. Classes queue as mutations in IndexedDB and upload via MutationManager with trial dependency tracking. (2026-02-24) — Root cause: **storage layer architecture mismatch**. Shows and trials use offline-first `ReplicatedTable` (IndexedDB only), but classes use direct Supabase inserts via React Query (`useClassStoreCompat → createClassMutation → supabase.from('classes').insert()`). When wizard publishes, the `trial_id` FK on the `classes` table references trials that only exist in IndexedDB, not in Supabase's `trials` table, so ALL class inserts fail with FK constraint violations. Additionally, `createClasses()` in `useShowCreationWizardActions.ts:115-118` fires off `addClass()` in a `forEach` without `await`, so errors are unhandled promises. **Impact:** Show publishes but has zero classes — users see "No classes available yet" on the show detail page. **Fix options:** (1) Make classes use offline-first storage like trials, (2) Ensure trials sync to Supabase before class creation, (3) Use a single Supabase transaction for trials + classes. **Files:** `useShowCreationWizardActions.ts:103-118`, `useClassStoreCompat.ts:101-106`, `classQueries.ts:173-209`.

### CRITICAL: Replication Layer Not Syncing to Supabase

- [x] **Zero rows in Supabase despite data visible in UI** — Fixed: extracted MutationManager into shared `@myk9/replication` package. All 6 table subclasses (shows, trials, classes, entries, dogs, clubs) now queue mutations via `queueMutation()` after `set()`. ReplicationSyncProvider runs Phase 1 upload before Phase 2 download. Startup flush, reconnect handler, and sync-requested event listener added. (2026-02-24) — All Supabase tables (`shows`, `trials`, `classes`) have 0 rows. Shows and trials are only stored in IndexedDB via `ReplicatedTable`. The UI works because it reads from local cache (Zustand stores populated from IndexedDB). Data is never reaching Supabase. This means **all show data is local-only and will be lost if the browser cache is cleared**. The `ReplicatedTrialsTable` constructor passes `undefined` as the second parameter to `super()` which may disable remote sync. **Files:** `ReplicatedTrialsTable.ts:66-68`, `@myk9/replication` package.

### HIGH: Newly Created Users Don't Appear in Dropdowns

- [x] **Inline-created person not available in chairman/secretary dropdown** — Fixed: (1) userStore `persist.merge` syncs `people` from `users` on rehydration (was `[]` after rehydration since `people` wasn't persisted), (2) creation panels now `await` the `selectionCallback` before calling `onResult` so the store refresh completes before the panel closes, (3) `selectionCallback` type updated to `void | Promise<void>`. **Files:** `userStore.ts`, `ShowDetailsStep.tsx`, `UserCreationPanel.tsx`, `ClubCreationPanel.tsx`, `JudgeCreationPanel/index.tsx`, `panels/types.ts`.

### MEDIUM: Club Shows "Unknown Club" After Inline Creation

- [x] **Club shows "Unknown Club" after inline creation in wizard** — Fixed: `ClubCreationPanel.handleSave()` now `await addClub()` (was fire-and-forget, so club wasn't in IndexedDB when `loadClubs()` ran), and `selectionCallback` is awaited so `loadClubs()` completes before panel closes. **Files:** `ClubCreationPanel.tsx`, `ShowDetailsStep.tsx`.

### MEDIUM: Trial 2 Defaults to Same Date as Trial 1

- [x] **Multi-day show: Trial 2 gets same date as Trial 1** — Fixed: `handleAddTrial` now defaults new trials to the day after the latest existing trial's date (capped at `show.endDate`). First trial still defaults to `show.startDate`. **Files:** `TrialConfigurationStep.tsx`.

### LOW: Escape Key in Date Picker Triggers Navigation Dialog

- [x] **Pressing Escape to close date picker popover triggers "Unsaved Changes" navigation dialog** — Fixed: wizard's global Escape handler now checks for open overlays (`[data-open]` for Base UI, `[data-state="open"]` for Radix) before triggering the navigation dialog. Escape only closes the innermost overlay. **Files:** `ShowCreationWizardPage.tsx`.

### LOW: Console Warnings for Base UI Select Components

- [x] **Base UI Select controlled/uncontrolled state warnings** — Fixed: Select wrapper now always passes `value` to Base UI when caller provides it (even empty string), maintaining consistent controlled state. Previously, empty strings were normalized to `undefined` which omitted the `value` prop, making the component uncontrolled until a selection was made. **Files:** `select/select.tsx`.
