-- MYK9-329: view_authenticated_entry_results must not grant can_manage on a
-- club-less show to every club admin and secretary on the platform.
--
-- MYK9-258 (20260828230000) established that a show with NULL club_id is
-- manageable only by site admins and fixed the five SQL helpers with that
-- shape. This owner-run view (security_invoker = false, so RLS on `entries`
-- is not a backstop) still carried the arm
--
--     OR (sh.club_id IS NULL AND ctx.has_manager_role)
--
-- in its can_manage flag. `has_manager_role` is true for a club_admin or
-- club-scoped secretary of ANY club, so a secretary of club A reading a
-- club-less show got can_manage = true, and with it can_view_admin: the masked
-- payment_status, entry_fee, payment_reference, payment_notes, refund_*,
-- stripe_payment_intent_id columns, plus can_view_scores (judge_notes,
-- total_score, ...). The arm was re-emitted verbatim by 20260828200000 and not
-- touched by 20260830240000's rewrite of the caller context.
--
-- Change: drop that arm. Everything else in the view body is byte-identical to
-- 20260828200000, so the output column list is unchanged and CREATE OR REPLACE
-- applies without a DROP (which would reset the view's ACL).
--
-- `private.entry_results_caller_context()` still returns `has_manager_role`;
-- the column is simply no longer consulted here. Removing it would mean
-- rebuilding the context function for no behavioural gain.
--
-- WITH (security_invoker = false) is restated inline: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
-- resets reloptions when the clause is omitted (see 20260817190000 and the
-- CLAUDE.md lesson). `entry_views_soft_delete_test.sql` asserts the setting.
--
-- Behavioural coverage: supabase/tests/null_club_show_authorization_test.sql
-- case 5 (foreign-club secretary sees no rows for the club-less show, site
-- admin still does, secretary still sees their own club's payment columns) and
-- myk9_114_entry_access_context_test.sql (the manager/null-club parity case now
-- asserts the reverse).
