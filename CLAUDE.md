## Communication Style

Keep responses concise, short, and to the point. Lead with the answer or action. Skip preamble, filler, and summaries of completed work.

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript monorepo. Always use TypeScript (not JavaScript). When fixing types, verify property names match the actual schema/interface definitions — do not guess.

## Intent & Emotional Design

**Before making UX-facing changes, read [`docs/INTENT.md`](docs/INTENT.md).** It defines the emotional intent behind each role's experience. Every optimization, refactoring, or "improvement" to user-facing code should preserve the target feeling for that role. If code has an `// INTENT:` comment, do not remove or change the described behavior without explicit approval.

## Development Principles

1. **Don't guess or assume** — Verify facts, check actual code, ask if uncertain
2. **Follow DRY principles** — Don't Repeat Yourself. Create reusable components if possible
3. **Follow SLC** — Simple, Lovable, Complete. Avoid feature bloat (Simple). Prioritize UX polish, error states, and "delight" (Lovable). Deliver end-to-end functionality with zero placeholders or TODOs (Complete)
4. **Keep files under 500 lines** — Extract types, helpers, and constants into sibling modules
5. **Protect intent** — When code looks "wrong" but has an `// INTENT:` comment, it's deliberate. When making UX changes, check if they preserve the role's target feeling (see `docs/INTENT.md`)

## Worktrees

Git worktrees share history but **not** gitignored files (`node_modules/`, `.env`, `dist/`). A `PostToolUse` hook runs `scripts/bootstrap-worktree.sh` automatically after `EnterWorktree`. If something is missing, run it manually:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap-worktree.sh   # installs deps, copies .env, builds packages
```

## Planning

When creating implementation or remediation plans, always save them to a markdown file (e.g., `PLAN.md` or `docs/plan-<topic>.md`) rather than only outputting to chat. Follow existing plans when they exist — do not start from scratch. **Every plan must include a testing phase** — unit tests for new components, hooks, and utilities. Do not consider a phase complete until its tests are written and passing.

## Commands

```bash
# Package manager: pnpm (not npm)
pnpm install          # Install all dependencies
pnpm dev:show         # Run myK9Show dev server (localhost:5173)
pnpm dev:q            # Run myK9Q dev server
pnpm build            # Build all packages and apps
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript check across monorepo
pnpm lint             # ESLint across monorepo

# Testing (run from app directories)
cd apps/myk9q && pnpm test        # myK9Q unit tests (vitest)
cd apps/myk9show && pnpm test     # myK9Show unit tests (vitest)
cd apps/myk9q && pnpm test:e2e    # myK9Q E2E tests (playwright)
cd apps/myk9show && pnpm test:e2e # myK9Show E2E tests (playwright)

# Run a single test file
cd apps/myk9show && npx vitest run src/path/to/file.test.ts
# Run tests matching a name pattern
cd apps/myk9show && npx vitest run -t "pattern"
```

## Architecture Decisions

- **UI library (myK9Show):** Base UI via shadcn/ui — NOT Radix (Radix stagnated after WorkOS acquisition)
- **UI library (myK9Q):** Semantic CSS — do not add Tailwind to myK9Q
- **Database:** Unified Supabase project (`myk9-platform`) for both apps
- **Formatting:** Prettier auto-format hook runs on every file edit

## Database Configuration

- **Project ref:** `sojmvhhwsjxmfistvzbe`
- **Edge Functions:** Deploy with `--no-verify-jwt` (functions handle auth internally)
- **Migrations:** `supabase/migrations/` — numbered `NNN_description.sql`

## Deployment

- **myK9Show staging:** myk9-platform-myk9show.vercel.app (auto-deploys from `main`)
- **myK9Q staging:** myk9-platform-myk9q.vercel.app (auto-deploys from `main`)
- **Legacy production:** myk9q.com (separate repo, untouched)

## Key Patterns

### Offline-first data (myK9Q)

Always use replicated tables — never bypass with direct Supabase calls (breaks offline):

```typescript
import { replicatedClassesTable } from '@myk9/replication';
await replicatedClassesTable.updateClassStatus(classId, status);
```

### State Management

| Tool                  | Use For                                  | Examples                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Zustand**           | Client/UI state shared across components | Modals, filters, selections, domain stores |
| **React Query**       | Server state, async data fetching        | Lists, detail views, search results        |
| **React Context**     | Cross-cutting concerns (rarely changes)  | Auth/RBAC, theme, app-wide config          |
| **@myk9/replication** | Persistent data that must work offline   | Show data, class entries, scores (myK9Q)   |
| **Local `useState`**  | Ephemeral, component-scoped state        | Form inputs, timers, dialog open/close     |

## Testing

Always ensure generated test code compiles cleanly: no `await` outside `async`, no unused variables (remove them, don't underscore-prefix), and run the test suite before considering work complete.

When test runners hang or appear stuck for more than 30 seconds, stop and report the issue rather than retrying in a loop. Known issue: test suite has pre-existing timeout/hanging problems.

Use the custom render from `src/test/utils/testUtils.tsx` instead of raw `render` — it wraps with QueryClient, Auth, and Router providers.

## Workflow

Update plan/tracking documents (TO-DOS.md, sprint docs, debt register) after completing each task or sprint item. Keep them in sync with actual progress.
