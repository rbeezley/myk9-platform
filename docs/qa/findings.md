# QA Findings Registry

Durable index for proactive QA findings. Use this for bugs found by `qa-feature`, `audit-pages`, `harden`, browser walks, Playwright traces, and future QA scripts.

## Status Values

- `open`: confirmed and not fixed.
- `in-progress`: fix is underway.
- `fixed`: fixed and proof has passed.
- `deferred`: accepted risk or out of scope for the current sprint.

## Finding Lifecycle

1. Create a finding only when the issue is reproducible or has durable evidence.
2. Keep the finding in `Open Findings` while the issue is unresolved, even if a fix is being attempted.
3. Set status to `fixed` only after the `Proof required` command or manual replay passes.
4. Move fixed findings to `Closed Findings` in the same change that records the proof result.
5. If the issue is intentionally not fixed, set status to `deferred` and keep the reason in `Notes`.
6. If a finding is noisy or stale, either refresh the evidence or close it as superseded; do not let unowned findings accumulate.

## Flake Budget

Active Nightly specs are trusted only while they stay reliable. Track repeated Nightly failures in `docs/qa/nightly-history.md`.

- A single failure opens or updates a finding with the failed command and trace/screenshot path.
- Two failures for the same active spec within 14 days mark it `test-flake` unless a product bug is proven.
- Below roughly 95% pass rate over the last 14 scheduled runs, demote the spec from `Nightly Active` to `Nightly Candidates / Repair Queue` in `docs/qa/e2e-suite-map.md`.
- Re-promote only after the spec passes alone and in the full active Nightly command with `--retries=0`.

## Severity Values

- `blocker`: prevents a target role from completing a core workflow.
- `high`: user-facing workflow failure, silent failure, data loss risk, or role/RLS mismatch.
- `medium`: confusing, stale, inaccessible, or missing feedback but workaround exists.
- `low`: polish, noisy warning, or low-risk inconsistency.

## Pattern Values

Use the closest existing pattern before inventing a new one:

- `silent-no-op`
- `missing-feedback`
- `missing-loading-state`
- `hidden-validation`
- `validation-visible-mismatch`
- `role-scope-empty`
- `role-rls-mismatch`
- `mutation-stale-cache`
- `swallowed-error`
- `stale-derived-state`
- `broken-navigation`
- `console-error`
- `network-error`
- `mobile-layout-break`
- `accessibility-gap`
- `test-flake`

## Finding Template

Copy this block for each new finding.

```markdown
### QA-<PATTERN>-###

- **Status:** open
- **Severity:** high
- **Role:** exhibitor | secretary | judge | steward | admin | all
- **Surface:** route/component/file
- **Suite category:** pr-smoke | nightly | feature-audit | manual-debug | candidate-delete | none
- **Pattern:** silent-no-op
- **Detected by:** qa-feature | audit-pages | harden | Playwright | manual | script
- **Evidence:** code reference, trace path, screenshot path, console/network output, or reproduction steps
- **User impact:** what the user experiences in plain English
- **Intent check:** which role feeling is harmed or preserved
- **Fix owner:** file/module area
- **Proof required:** exact test, command, or manual replay required before closing
- **Notes:** optional context, linked PR, migration number, or deferral reason
```

## Open Findings

No Phase 0 findings have been logged yet. Add new findings above this line as they are confirmed.

## Closed Findings

Move fixed findings here only after the `Proof required` line has passed.
